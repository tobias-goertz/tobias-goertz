## Hey! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1643514747/7550/pikachu_wave.gif?1643514747" width="30px">

I'm Tobi & I'm currently Leading the Platform & Security team at [charles](https://hello-charles.com) ðŸ’›.

I'm all about solving tough problems and finding quick wins. I love getting into the nitty-gritty of infrastructureâ€”honestly, I probably know where every container is better than I know where my stuff is at home! Staying calm in any situation is my thing, and I enjoy the challenge of firefighting when things get heated ðŸ”¥. I'm a realist and keep things rational, which helps me and my team at Charles keep things running smoothly. I also have a passion for business and product details and love bouncing ideas with others.

ðŸ¤“ nerdy stuff I love to run on my servers:
- self build on-call for my camper van to get notified if it gets stolen again (with PAJ, n8n, twilio)
- [flathunter](https://github.com/flathunters/flathunter), to combat the :poop: flat market in Berlin
- [Hipstermaps](https://hipstermaps.goertz.digital/), awesome gift if you love to print your own city map @[fotoparadies](https://www.fotoparadies.de/)
